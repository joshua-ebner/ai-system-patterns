# Documentation Corpus

This corpus contains curated AI engineering documentation
used as the knowledge base for the RAG system.

Documents are manually selected to ensure:
- Technical relevance
- Reliable grounding for answers

Phase 1 will include select documentation for 
LangChain and OpenAI.

Future phases expand this corpus with
LangGraph and LangSmith documentation.
